**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this crowdfunding product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
